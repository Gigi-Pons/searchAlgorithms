# Search Algorithms

## Linear Search
Searches a value in an array using linear search.
<br /> Time complexity = O(n)
<br /> Space complexity = O(1)
*

## Binary Search
Reads a file into a vector.  The content of this file is in ascending order.
Some numbers do repeat, the user can enter any of the numbers in the list and the
algorithm will return the first and last index of the value entered.
If it is not found, it will return -1.

<br /> Time complexity = O(logn)
<br /> Space complexity = O(1)
